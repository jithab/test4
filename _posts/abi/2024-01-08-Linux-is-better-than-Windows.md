One of my colleagues came to my desk and looked at the Linux machine I was working on. I was the only one who was working on a Linux machine in the company. He said he had heard that Linux was faster than Windows, and he wished to learn it. 

I confirmed that Linux was faster and better than Windows. I considered proving it with some demonstration so that he would be inspired to master the Linux Operating System.

I took a file folder containing thousands of files and performed a task on it. The task was completed in a couple of seconds. I sent the folder to him and asked to perform the same task on his Windows machine. The task took almost half a minute on his machine.

He was blown away by the efficiency of Linux. I was delighted to be able to show him the true power of Linux. I went back to my desk and resumed my office work.

The warning we got while performing the task on the Windows machine came into my mind: Incompatible file endings. I looked up on the internet and learned that in such a scenario Windows would modify files to make them compatible with Windows. The files which were used for the task were Linux-compatible files.

I understood why the task took more time on Windows: The files were being converted into Windows format, which was a slow disk operation. The demo was flawed since the environment for the demo was in favour of Linux.

I got up from my seat to inform the colleague about the flaw. Suddenly, a question came to my mind: why should I let him know the flaw? I believed Linux was better than Windows. Rather than telling it to my colleague, I tried to show him. I used the demo as an instrument to instil my belief in him. Even though the instrument was flawed, I achieved my intention. The end justifies the means, doesn't it? 

I sat down in my seat. I wanted to show another demo to prove my point, but I couldnâ€™t find a better task at the moment. I decided to inform him about the flaw once I was able to show a proper demo in the future.
