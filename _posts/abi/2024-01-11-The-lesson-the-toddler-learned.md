<div class="abi">
A next-door toddler entered my room, carrying a test tube containing some white liquid, which was the liquid for producing soap bubbles, and started jumping barefoot on my front door carpet, which was full of pointy threads, as usual. 

She spilled the liquid while jumping and the floor became dirty. She looked anxiously at me. I felt she would cry and decided to handle the situation smoothly so that she would feel relaxed and not guilty. I giggled as if I was enjoying a funny moment. I told her one minute and went into my kitchen to get some old clothes, and cleaned up the floor. She smiled and left. 

Our response to such scenarios might create lifelong trauma in the kid. I tremble whenever I have to take a cup of tea to my table from the tea counter in a restaurant. I don’t have such an issue in my room. The reason could be some experience in my childhood which might be triggering nervousness in me in public spaces.  

The toddler came again the next day, carrying a bottle of water. She poured the water on my floor and looked at me expecting that I would giggle at the funny thing she had done. Apparently, the toddler learned her own lesson from the incident, which was not what I intended or imagined.

What is the modern psychology-certified way of changing such behaviour? I couldn’t recall any psychology lessons I learned, but I knew the traditional way of correcting such nasty behaviour. I looked into my kitchen and saw a coconut broomstick, which was short and thin, suitable for caning.
