    <li> <b>This article was amended on 19 October 2018 to clarify that: Ipso was not asked to adjudicate on the whole Times series, only the third article, which was the subject of the Ipso upheld complaint; Ipso specified that its adjudication about the third article be published on page six or further forward in the paper – the Times was not compelled by Ipso to use page one; Ipso did not uphold a complaint by Miqdaad Versi about a Sun article published on 1 December 2016 - Ipso found that paraphrasing in the article was not “significantly misleading” and welcomed the newspaper’s offer during the Ipso process to amend the article; and the Sun was not forced to correct a 4 December 2016 article about which Miqdaad Versi complained - the Sun corrected that article and apologised as part of an Ipso mediation process.</b>
