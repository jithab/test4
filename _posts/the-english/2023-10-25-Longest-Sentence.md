    <li> <b>In the early years of the 21st century, the inevitability of an ever more competitive, deregulated, internationally orientated market economy, to which both government and society were subordinate – a doctrine often called neoliberalism – was accepted right across the mainstream of British politics: from the Thatcherites who still dominated the Conservative party; to the increasingly pro-business Liberal Democrats, who would soon form a coalition government with the Tories; to the Scottish National party, whose then leader Alex Salmond praised Ireland and Iceland for their low corporate taxes; to the Blair cabinet itself, where, I was told by a senior Labour figure in 2001, “You won’t find a single member with anything critical to say about capitalism.”</b>

    <li> <b>This article was amended on 19 October 2018 to clarify that: Ipso was not asked to adjudicate on the whole Times series, only the third article, which was the subject of the Ipso upheld complaint; Ipso specified that its adjudication about the third article be published on page six or further forward in the paper – the Times was not compelled by Ipso to use page one; Ipso did not uphold a complaint by Miqdaad Versi about a Sun article published on 1 December 2016 - Ipso found that paraphrasing in the article was not “significantly misleading” and welcomed the newspaper’s offer during the Ipso process to amend the article; and the Sun was not forced to correct a 4 December 2016 article about which Miqdaad Versi complained - the Sun corrected that article and apologised as part of an Ipso mediation process.</b>

    <li> <b>Heywood has been so central to British government for so long that few of its most contentious modern episodes have not involved him: the Iraq war and its aftermath; the hasty formation of the coalition; the Conservatives’ encouragement of Rupert Murdoch’s abortive bid for BSkyB; the News of the World phone-hacking scandal and Cameron’s employment of its former editor Andy Coulson; the alleged gagging of ministers over airport expansion and the EU referendum; the row over British plans to restrict benefits for EU migrants; the Plebgate affair that ruined the government chief whip Andrew Mitchell; the government’s refusal to release official papers on the treatment of trade unionists and other Tory foes during the 1970s and 1980s; the attempted silencing of the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.</b>
