    <li> Putting up a <b>statue</b> is an attempt to create a story about history.

    </li>
    <li> Rather than teaching us about the past, his <b>statue</b> distorts history.

    <li> Nor is anyone seeking historical closure via the removal of a <b>statue</b>.

    </li>
    <li> For if the erection of a <b>statue</b> is a fact of history, then removing it is no less so.

    <li> When the <b>statue</b> finally rose off of its base, a huge, sustained cry went up from the crowd.

    <li> Indeed, if the people removing a <b>statue</b> are trying to erase history, then they are very bad at it.

    <li> This <b>statue</b> obsession mistakes adulation for history, history for heritage and heritage for memory.

    <li> To put up a <b>statue</b> you must own the land on which it stands and have the authority and means to do so.

    <li> I had originally opposed this tactic, worrying that focusing on the <b>statue</b> would obscure our larger mission.

    <li> The <b>statue</b>’s disproportionately tiny head, topped with its disarmingly jaunty military hat, looks almost comical.
